# Pokedex

A simple pokedex made with Flutter. All pokemon data is stored in `assets/data`, no need for an internet connection (except for images).

All the data is provided by [my Dart PokeAPI wrapper](https://github.com/Dewaeq/pokeapi).

## TODO


-   Save all the pokemon data somewhere online and let the app check for updates. 

    Currently, if we change the data we need to update the app.

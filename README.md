# Pokedex

A simple pokedex made with Flutter. All pokemon data is stored in `assets/data`, no need for an internet connection (except for images).

All the data is provided by [my Dart PokeAPI wrapper](https://github.com/Dewaeq/pokeapi).

## TODO


-   Save all the pokemon data somewhere online and let the app check for updates. 

    Currently, if we change the data we need to update the app.

-   Just like the pokedex tab, create a page with a list of every ability.

-   Add the option to sort pokemon by a specific property or stat.

## Done:

-   In the pokemon details page, add some buttons to go to the next or previous pokemon
-   Show more info about an egg group, like we do with abilities.
